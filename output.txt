In, life, we've, seen, within, this, part, of, the,world, great, people, like, Al-Khawarizmi, who, invented,algorithm.
Globally, Newton, Henry, Ford, the, Wright, Brothers,Albert, Einstein, and, Elon, Musk.
See, you, are, in, rush,You, want, to, go, to, places, that, nobody, has, been.
You, are, re-inventing, a, certain, industry,from, the, rocket, industry, with, SpaceX, to, the, car, industry, with, Tesla.
What's, your, life, mission, Why, do, you, do, whatever, you, do, Sure, first, of, all, thank, you, for, having, me.
It's, an, honor, to, be, here.
And, I'm, having, a, really, great, time, with, my,kids, in, Dubai.
It's, really, been, fantastic.
I, really, encourage,anyone, who, hasn't, been, to, visit, what, a, great, city!, Thank, you.
And, in, terms, of, the, motivations,I, used, to, like, this, sort, of.
kind, of, a, long, version, of, the, explanation,but.
essentially, when, I, was, a, kid, I, was, wondering,what's, the, meaning, of, life, Like, why, are, we, here, What, is, it, all, about, And, I, came, to, the, conclusion, that, what, really,matters, is, trying, to, understand, the, right, questions, to,ask.
And, the, more, that, we, can, increase, the, scope,and, scale, of, human, consciousness, the, better, we're, able, to, ask, these, questions.
And.
So, I, think, there, are, certain, things, that,are, necessary, to, ensure, that, the, future, is, good.
And,,some, of, those, things, are, in, the, long, term, having,long, term, sustainable, transport, and, sustainable, energy, generation.
And, to, be, a, space, exploring, civilization.
And, for, humanity, to, be, out, there, among, the,stars.
And, be, a, multi-planetary, species.
I, think, that, being, a, multi-planetary, species,and, being, out, there, among, the, stars, is, important, for, the, long-term, survival, of,humanity.
And, that's, one, reason, kind, of, like, life,insurance, for, life, collectively.
Life, as, we, know, it.
But, then, the, part, that, I, find, personally, most,motivating, is, that, it, creates, a, sense, of, adventure,and, it, makes, people, excited, about, the, future.
If, you, consider, two, futures, one, where, we,are, forever, confined, to, Earth, until, eventually, something, terrible, happens.
Or, another, future, where, we, are, out, there, on,many, planets, maybe, even, going, beyond, the, solar, system.
I, think, that, space, invasion, is, incredibly,exciting, and, inspiring.
And, there, need, to, be, reasons, to, get, up, in,the, morning.
You, know, life, can't, just, be, about, solving,problems.
Otherwise, what's, the, point, There's, got, to, be, things, that, people, find,inspiring, and, make, life, worth, living.
So, what, is, life, for, you, I, mean, you, look, at, our, life, and, I, heard,you, before, speaking.
Is, it, a, dream, Is, it, real, Is, it, a, million, deal, What, is, life, for, Elon, Musk, I, find, that, as, I, get, older, I, find, that, question,to, be, maybe, more, and, more, confusing, or, troubling,or, uncertain.
Particularly, when, you, see, the, advancement,of, something, like, video, games.
You, know, 40, years, ago, you, had, video, games,the, most, advanced, video, game, would, be, like, Pong, when, you, had, two, rectangles, and,a, dot.
And, you're, like, batting, it, back, and, forth.
-, I, played, it.
-, Yeah, me, too, exactly.
-, Us, all.
-, It, sort, of, dates, you, a, little, bit.
Yeah, we, both, played, the, same, game.
And, that, was, like, a, pretty, fun, game, at, the,time.
But, now, you, can, see, a, video, game, that's, photo-realistic,almost, photo-realistic, and, millions, of, people, playing, simultaneously.
And, and, you, see, where, things, are, going, with,virtual, reality.
And, augmented, reality, and,,if, you, extrapolate, that, out, into, the, future, with, any, rate, of, progress, at, all,like, keeping, 0,1%, of, something, like, that, a, year,then, eventually, those, games, will, be, indistinguishable, from, reality.
They'll, be, so, realistic, you, won't, be, able,to, tell, the, difference, between, that, game, and, reality, as, we, know, it.
And, then, it, seems, like, well,how, do, we, know, that, that, didn't, happen, in, the, past, And, that, we're, not, in, one, of, those, games, ourselves, Interesting.
Interesting.
I, mean, it, could, be.
Everything, is, possible, in, life.
I, mean, there's.
Yeah, particularly, like, things, tend, to, be,accelerating, to, something.
Isn't, it, I, mean, if, we, look, at, our, life,it, seems, in, the, past, 100, years, life, has, been, accelerating, quite, fast.
-, Yeah.
-, In, the, past, 20, years.
-, It's, getting, faster, and, faster.
-, Is, it, more, slow, So, my, question, is, really, how, will, life, be,20, 30, 50, years, from, now, Our, education, our, transport.
How, do, you, see, it, Well, I, think, this, is, one, of, those, things,that, are, quite, difficult, to, predict.
When, you, think, of, say, the, first, controlled,power, flight, was, in, 1903, with, the, Wright, Brothers.
And, then, 66, years, later, we, put, the, first,people, on, the, moon.
I, mean, if, you, asked, people, say, in, 1900,what, are, the, odds, of, landing, on, the, moon, they, would've, said, that's, ridiculous.
If, you, try, to, talk, to, them, about, the, internet,they, wouldn't, know, what, the, heck, you're, even.
What, are, you, talking, about, Like, this, sounds, so, crazy.
But, today, with, a, hundred-dollar, device, you,can, video-conference, with, anyone, in, the, world.
On, the, other, side, of, the, world, and, if, you,have, a, Wi-Fi, connection, it's, basically, free.
You're, free, to, have, an, instant, visual, communication,with, anyone, or, even, with, millions, of, people.
You, know, with, social, media, you, can, communicate,to, millions, of, people, simultaneously.
So, and, you, can, google, something, and, ask, any,question.
It's, like, an, oracle, of, wisdom,that, you, can, ask, almost, any, questions, and, get, an, instant, response.
It, would, be, incredibly, difficult, to, predict,these, things, in, the, past.
Even, the, relatively, recent, past.
So, I, think, the, one, thing, that, we, can, be, quite,certain, of, is, that, any, predictions, we, make, today, for,what, the, future, will, be, like, in, 50, years, will, be, wrong,That's, for, sure.
I, think, directionally,I, can, tell, you, what, I, hope, the, future, has, as, opposed, to, maybe, what, it, will, be.
This, may, just, be, wishful, thinking.
I, mean, I, hope, we, are, out, there, on, Mars, and,maybe, beyond, Mars, Jupiter.
I, hope, we're, traveling, frequently, throughout,the, solar, system, perhaps, preparing, for, missions, to, nearby, star,systems.
I, think, all, of, that, is, possible, in, 50, years.
And, I, think, it's, going, to, be, very, exciting,to, do, that.
And, I, think, we'll, see, autonomy, and, artificial,intelligence, advance, tremendously.
Like, that's, actually, quite, near, term.
My, guess, is, in, probably, 10, years,it, will, be, very, unusual, for, cars, to, be, built, that, are, not, fully, autonomous.
-, 10, years.
-, 10, years, from, now, Yeah.
I, think, almost, all, cars, built, will, be, able,of, full, autonomy, in, about, 10, years.
As, it, is, the, Tesla, cars, that, are, made, today,have, the, sensor, system, necessary, for, full, autonomy.
And, we, think, probably, enough, compute, power,to, be, safer, than, a, person.
So, it's, mostly, just, the, question, of, developing,the, software, and, uploading, the, software.
And, if, it, turns, out, that, more, compute, power,is, needed, we, can, easily, upgrade, the, computer.
And, so, that's, all, Teslas, built, since, October,last, year.
And, other, manufacturers, will, follow, and, do,the, same, thing.
So, getting, in, a, car, will, be, like, getting,in, an, elevator.
You, just, tell, it, where, you, want, to, go, and,it, takes, you, there, with, extreme, levels, of, safety.
And, that, will, be, normal, that, will, just, be,normal.
Like, for, elevators, they, used, to, be, elevator,operators.
You, get, in, there, will, be, a, guy, moving, a, lever.
Now, you, just, get, in, you, press, the, button,and, that's, taken, for, granted.
So, autonomy, will, be, wide-spread.
I, think, one, of, the, most, troubling, questions,is, artificial, intelligence.
And, I, don't, mean, narrow, AI, like,vehicle, autonomy, I, would, put, in, the, narrow, AI, class.
It's, narrowly, trying, to, achieve, a, certain,function.
But, deep, artificial, intelligence,or, what, is, sometimes, called, artificial, general, intelligence,where, you, can, have, AI, that, is, much, smarter, than, the, smartest, human, on, Earth.
This, I, think, is, a, dangerous, situation.
Why, is, it, dangerous, I, mean, there, are, two, views,one, view, is, that, artificial, intelligence, will, help, humanity,and, there's, another, school, of, thought, that, artificial, intelligence, is, a, threat, to, humanity.
-, Why, is, that, -, I, think, it's, both.
You, know, it's, like,,one, way, to, think, of, it, is, imagine, we're, going, to, be, visited,,imagine, you're, very, confident, that, we're, going, to, be, visited, by,super, intelligent, aliens, in, let's, say, 10, years, or, 20, years, at, the, most.
-, Super, intelligent.
-, So, you, think, within, 20, years.
-, Yeah.
-, we'll, have, aliens, on, Earth, Well, digital, super, intelligence, will, be, like,an, alien.
-, It, will, be, like, an, alien.
-, Yeah.
But, my, question, is, do, you, think,there, is, other, intelligent, life, outside, the, Earth, It, seems, probable.
I, think, this, is, one, of, the, great, questions,in, physics, and, philosophy, is, where, are, the, aliens, Maybe, they, are, among, us, I, don't, know.
Some, people, think, I'm, an, alien.
Not, true.
-, Not, true.
-, But, maybe, we, are, aliens.
Maybe, we, aliens.
I, mean, if, you, look, at, this, part, of, the, world.
Yeah.
They, believe, that, human, beings, are, not, from,Earth, they, came, from, somewhere, else.
Eve, and, Adam, came, from, somewhere, else, to, Earth.
So, in, a, way, human, beings, are, aliens, to, this,land.
Do, you, think, we'll, make, contact, with, aliens,within, the, next, 50, years, Well, that's, a, really, tough, one, to, say.
If, there, are, super, intelligent, aliens, out,there, they're, probably, already, observing, us.
That, would, seem, quite, likely, and, we're, not,smart, enough, to, realize, it.
But, I, can, do, some, back, of, the, envelope, calculations,and.
any, advanced, alien, civilization, that, is, at,all, interested, in, populating, the, galaxy,even, without, exceeding, the, speed, of, light, even, if, you're, only, moving, at, say, 10, or,20, per, cent, of, the, speed, of, light, you, could, populate, the, entire, galaxy, in, let's,say, 10, million, years.
Maybe, 20, million, years, max.
This, is, nothing, in, the, grand, scheme, of, things.
Once, you, said, you, wanted, to, die, on, Mars.
Why, To, be, clear, I, don't, want, to, die, on, Mars.
It's, like, if.
we're, all, going, to, die, someday,and, if, you're, going, to, pick, some, place, to, die,then, why, not, Mars, You, know, if, you're, born, on, Earth, why, not,die, on, Mars, Seems, like, may, be, quite, exciting.
But, I, think, given, the, choice, between, dying,on, Earth, and, dying, on, Mars, I'd, say, yeah, sure, I'll, die, on, Mars.
But, it's, not, some, kind, of, Mars, death, wish.
And, if, I, do, die, on, Mars, I, just, don't, want,to, go, on, impact.
Let's, come, back, to, Earth, actually.
You, tweeted, that, you, are, building, a, tunnel,under, Washington, D,C.
Why, What, is, it, -, It's, a, secret, plot.
-, Okay.
-, Just, between, us.
-, Nobody, helps, you, Yeah, exactly, let's, keep, that, a, secret.
I, think, this, is, going, to, sound, a, little.
I, mean, it, seems, like, so, much, trivial, or, silly,but.
I've, been, saying, this, for, many, years, now, but,I, think, that, the, solution, to, urban, congestion, is, a, network,of, tunnels, under, cities.
And, when, I, say, that, I, don't, mean, a, 2-D, plan,of, tunnels, I, mean, tunnels, that, go, many, levels, deep.
So, you, can, always, go, deeper, than, you, can,go, up.
Like, the, deepest, mines, are, deeper, than, the,tallest, buildings.
So, you, can, have, a, network, of, tunnels, that,is, 20, 30, 40, 50, levels, as, many, levels, as, you, want, really.
And, so, given, that, you, can, overcome, the, congestion,situation, in, any, city, in, the, world.
The, challenge, is, how, do, you, build, tunnels,quickly, and, at, low, cost, and, with, high, safety, So, if, tunnel, technology, can, be, improved, to,the, point, where, you, can, build, tunnels, fast, cheap, and, safe,then, that, would, completely, get, rid, of, any, traffic, situations, in, the, cities.
And, so, that's, why, I, think, it's, an, important,technology.
And, Washington, D,C,, L,A, and, most, of, the,major, American, cities, most, major, cities, in, the, world, suffer, from,severe, traffic, issues.
And, it's, mostly, because, you've, got, these, buildings,which, are, these, tall, buildings, that, are, 3-D, and, you,have, a, road, network, that, is, one, level.
And, then, people, generally, want, to, go, in, and,out, of, these, buildings, at, the, exact, same, time.
So, then, you, get, the, traffic, jam.
Let's, come, back, to,,your, year, in, Dubai.
The, first, time, I, met, you, it, was, the, 4th, of,June, 2015, at, your, office, in, SpaceX.
And, I, asked, you, would, you, have, a, presence,in, UAE, And, your, answer, was:, I'm, busy, with, China.
Maybe, not, in, the, near, future, and, almost, a,year, and, a, half, later, we, are, here, seems, time, goes, quite, fast.
Why, now, I, think, actually, things, are, going, really, well,in, China.
So, we, have, some, initial, challenges, figuring,out, charging, and, service, infrastructure, and, various, other,things, but, now, it's, actually, going, really, well, and,,so, the, timing, seems, to, be, good, to, really, make, a, significant, debut,in, this, region, starting, in, Dubai.
In, your, opinion, what, is, the, new, disturbing,thing, that, will, come, next, in, technology, What's, next, in, technology, -, What's, next, in, technology, -, That, will, disturb, the, way, we, live,the, way, we, think, the, way, we, do, business.
Well, the, most, near, to, impact, from, a, technological,standpoint, is, autonomous, cars, like, fully, self-driving,cars.
I'd, say, that's, going, to, happen, much, faster,than, people, realize.
so, and, that's,,it's, going, to, be, a, great, convenience, to, be, in, an, autonomous, car,but, there, are, many, people, whose, job, is, to, drive.
So, if.
in, fact, I, think, it, might, be, the,single, largest, employer, of, people, is, driving, in, various, forms.
And, so, then, we, need, to, figure, out, new, rules,for, what, do, these, people, do.
But, it, will, all, be, very, disruptive, and, very,quick.
I, should, characterize, what, I, mean, by, quick.
Because, there, are.
Quick, means, different, things, to, different,people.
There, are, about, two, billion, vehicles, in, the,world.
Approaching, in, fact, 2,5, billion, cars, and, trucks,in, the, world.
The, total, new, vehicle, production, capacity,is, about, a, hundred, million.
Which, makes, sense, because, the, life, of, a, car,or, truck, before, it's, finally, scraped, is, about, 20-25,years.
So, so, the, point, at, which, we, see, full, autonomy,appear, will, not, be, the, point, at, which, there, is, massive,societal, upheaval, because, it, will, take, a, long, time, to, make, enough,autonomous, vehicles, to, disrupt, employment.
So, that, disruption, I'm, talking, about, will,take, place, over, about, 20, years.
Still, 20, years, is, a, short, period, of, time,to, have, I, think, something, like, 12, to, 15, per, cent, of, the, world, force, be, unemployed.
Thank, you.
This, is, the, largest, global, government, summit,we, have, over, 139, governments, here.
If, you, want, to, advise, government, officials,to, be, ready, for, the, future, what, three, pieces, of, advice, can, you, give, them, Well, I, think, the, first, bit, of, advice, is, to,really, play, close, attention, to.
the, development, of, artificial, intelligence.
I, think, this, is, we, need, to, be, just, be, very,careful, in.
how, we, adopt, artificial, intelligence,and, to, make, sure, that, researchers, don't, get, carried, away,because, sometimes, what, happens, is, that, scientists, can, get, so,engrossed, in, their, work, they, don't, necessarily, realize, the, ramifications,of, what, they're, doing.
So, I, think, it's, important, for, public, safety,that, we.
you, know, governments, keep, a, close, eye, on,artificial, intelligence, and, make, sure, that, it, does, not, represent, a,danger, to, the, public.
Let's, see, secondly, I, would, say,we, do, need, to, think, about, transport, in, general.
And,there's, the, movement, towards, electric, vehicles, sustainable, transport,I, think, that's, going, to, be, good, for, many, reasons, but, again,not, something, that, happens, immediately, that's, going, to, happen, slower, than,the, self-driving, vehicles.
Because, that's, probably, something, that, happens,over, 30, or, 40, years.
The, transition, to, electric, vehicles.
So, thinking, about, that, in, context,,the, demand, for, electricity, will, increase, dramatically.
So, currently, in, terms, of, total, energy, usage,in, the, world, it's, about, 1/3, about, 1/3, transport, about,1/3, heating.
So, over, time, that, will, transition, to, almost,all.
not, all, but, predominantly, electricity,which, means, that, the, demand, for, electricity, will, probably, triple.
So, it's, going, to, be, very, important, to, think,about, how, do, you, make, so, much, more, electricity,And.
It, seems, they'll, have, an, easy, job, that's,it, there, are, no, more, challenges, for, them.
No, well, I, think, maybe,,these, things, do, play, into, each, other, a, little, bit,but, what, to, do, about, mass, unemployment, This, is, going, to, be, a, massive, social, challenge.
And, I, think, ultimately, will, have, to, have, some,kind, of, universal, basic, income, I, don't, think, we're, going, to, have, a, choice.
-, Universal, basic, income.
-, Universal, basic, income.
I, think, it's, going, to, be, necessary.
So, it, means, that, unemployed, people, will, be,paid, across, the, globe.
-, Yeah.
-, Because, there, are, no, jobs.
Machines, robots, are, taking, over.
There, will, be, fewer, and, fewer, jobs, that, a,robot, cannot, do, better.
That's, simply.
And, I, want, to, be, clear, these, are, not, things,that, I, wish, would, happen.
These, are, simply, things, that, I, think, probably,will, happen.
And, so, if, my, assessment, is, correct, and, they,probably, will, happen, then, we, need, to, say, what, are, we, going, to, do,about, it.
And, I, think, some, kind, of, universal, basic, income,is, going, to, be, necessary.
Now, the, output, of, goods, and, services, will,be, extremely, high.
So, with, automation,there, will, come, abundance.
There, will, be.
almost, everything, will, get,very, cheap.
The.
So.
I, think, the, biggest.
I, think, we'll, just, end, up, doing,a, universal, basic, income.
It's, going, to, be, necessary.
The, harder, challenge, much, harder, challenge,is, how, do, people, then, have, meaning, Like, a, lot, of, people, they, derive, their, meaning,from, their, employment, so, if, you, don't, have.
if, you're, not, needed,if, there's, not, a, need, for, your, labor, how, do, you.
what's, the, meaning, Do, you, have, meaning, Do, you, feel, useless, That's, a, much, harder, problem, to, deal, with.
And, then, how, do, we, ensure, that, the, future,is, going, to, be, the, future, that, we, want, That, we, so, like.
You, know, I, mean, do, think, that, there's, a, potential,path, here, which, is, I'm, really, getting, into, science, fiction, or,sort, of, advanced, science, stuff.
But, having, some, sort, of, merger, with, biological,intelligence, and, machine, intelligence.
To, some, degree, we, are, already, a, cyborg.
You, think, of, like, the, digital, tools, that, you,have, your, phone, and, your, computer, the, applications,that, you, have.
Like, the, fact, that, as, I, mentioned, earlier,you, can, ask, a, question, and, instantly, get, an, answer, from, Google, or,from, other, things.
And, and, so, you, already, have, a, digital, touchery,layer.
I, say, touchery, because, you, can, think, of, the,limbic, system, kind, of, the, animal, brain, or, the, primal, brain,and, then, the, cortex, kind, of, the, thinking, planning, part, of, the,brain, and, then, your, digital, self, as, a, third, layer.
So, you, already, have, that, and, I, think, if,somebody, dies, their, digital, ghost, is, still, around.
All, of, their, e-mails, and, the, pictures, that,they, posted, and, their, social, media.
That, still, lives, even, if, they, died.
So, over, time, I, think, we'll, probably, see,a, closer, merger, of, biological, intelligence, and, digital, intelligence.
And, it's, mostly, about, the, bandwidth,the, speed, of, the, connection, between, your, brain, and, your, digital,,the, digital, extension, of, yourself.
Particularly, output, and, if, anything, is, getting,worse, you, know, we, used, to, have, keyboards, that, we,used, a, lot, now, we, do, most, of, our, input, through, our, thumbs,on, a, phone.
And, that's, just, very, slow.
A, computer, can, communicate, at, a, trillion, bits,per, second, but, your, thumb, can, maybe, do, maybe, 10, bits,per, second, or, a, hundred, if, you're, being, generous.
So, some, high, bandwidth, interface, to, the, brain,I, think, will, be, something, that, helps, achieve, symbiosis,between, human, and, machine, intelligence, and, maybe, solves,the, control, problem, and, the, usefulness, problem.
I'm, getting, pretty, esoteric, here, I, don't,know, is, this, is.
It's, close, we, got, it.
Always, you, think, out, of, the, box.
Your, ideas, are, so, huge.
You, want, to, go, to, space, you, decided, to, go,to, space, you, did, it.
You, decided, that, you, wanted, to, land, your, rocket,back, -, you, failed, 7, times, 8, times, -, Yeah, something, like, that.
-, Then, it, landed.
-, 4, times, that, I, care, to, count.
How, do, you, come, with, these, ideas, Sometimes, they, are, pushing, the, human, limit.
You, are, always, pushing, the, human, limit, why, Well, I.
I, think, about, what, technology, solution, is,necessary, in, order, to, achieve, that, particular, goal,and, then, try, to, make, as, much, progress, in, that, direction, as, possible.
So, in, the, case, of, space, flight, the, critical,breakthrough, that's, necessary, in, space, flight,is, rapid, incomplete, reusability, of, rockets.
Just, as, we, have, for, air, crafts.
You, can, imagine, that, if, an, air, craft, was, a,single, use, almost, no, one, would, fly.
Because, you, can, buy, like, say, 747, might, be.
250, million, Dollars, 300, million, Dollars,something, like, that.
You, need, two, of, them, for, a, round, trip.
But, nobody, is, going, to, pay, millions, of, Dollars,for, a, ticket, to, fly.
To, do, air, travel.
So, but, because, you, can, re-use, the, air, craft,tens, of, thousands, of, times, the.
Air, travel, becomes, much, more, affordable.
And, the, same, is, true, of, rockets.
Our, rocket, costs.
60, million, Dollars, roughly.
So, a, capital, cost, if, it, can, be, used, once,in, 60, million, Dollars.
But, if, the, capital, cost, if, it, can, be, used,a, thousand, times, is, 60, thousand, Dollars.
So, then, if, you, can, carry, a, lot, of, people,for, a, flight, then, you, can, get, the, cost, of, space, flight,to, be, something, not, far, from, the, cost, of, air, flight.
So, it's, truly, fundamental,because, earth, gravity, is, quite, deep.
Earth, has, a, fairly, high, gravity.
The, difficulty, of, making, a, rocket, reusable,is, much, greater, than, the, difficulty, of, making, an, air, craft, reusable.
That's, why, a, fully, reusable, rocket, hasn't,been, developed, that, far.
But, if, you, use, the, most, advanced, materials,the, most, advanced, design, techniques, and, you, get, everything, just, right,then, I'm, confident, that, you, can, do, a, fully, reusable, rocket.
Fortunately, if, Earth, gravity, was, even, 10,per, cent, stronger, I, would, say, it, wouldn't, be, impossible.
You, need, a, team, around, you, to, deliver, a, lot,of, ideas.
How, do, you, choose, your, team, Based, on, what, Well, I, suppose, honestly, that, it, tends, to,be, a, gut, feeling, more, than, anything, else.
So, when, I, interview, somebody,the, main, questions, are, always, the, same.
What, do, you, ask, I, say:, Tell, me, the, story, of, your, life.
And, the, decisions, that, you, made, along, the,way, and, why, you, made, them.
And, then,and, also, tell, me, about, some, of, the, most, difficult, problems, you, worked, on,and, how, you, solved, them.
And,that, question, I, think, is, very, important, because.
the, people, that, really, solved, the, problem,they, know, exactly, how, they, solved, it.
They, know, the, little, details.
And, the, people, that, pretended, to, solve, the,problem, they, can, maybe, go, one, level, and, then, they,get, stuck.
So, what, was, your, biggest, challenge, in, life, Biggest, challenge, in, life, -, No, challenge, -, Well, no, there's, a, lot, of, them.
I'm, trying, to, sort, which, is, the, worst.
I, think, just, thinking, about, how, to, spend, time.
One, of, the, biggest, challenges, I, think, is, making,sure, you, have, a, corrective, feedback, loop,and, then, maintaining, that, corrective, feedback, loop, over, time,even, when, people, won't, to, tell, you, exactly, what, you, want, to, hear.
-, That's, very, difficult.
-, Yes.
Time, is, over.
I'll, ask, you, just, one, last, question.
If, you, allow, me.
In, the, World, Government, Summit, we, have,so, many, people, from.
so, many, young, people, actually,from, across, the, Globe.
If, you, have, an, advice, to, them,young, people, globally, who, want, to, be, like, Elon, Musk.
What's, your, advice, to, them, I, think, that, probably, they, shouldn't, want,to, be.
-, You, -, I, think, it, sounds, better, than, it, is.
Okay.
Yeah, it's, not, as, much, fun, being, me, as, you'd,think.
-, I, don't, know.
-, You, don't, think, so, It, could, be, worse, for, sure.
But, it's.
I'm, not, sure, I, want, to, be, me.
Okay.
But.
You, know, I, think, my, advice, is, if, you, want,to, make, progress, in, things, I, think, that, the, best, analytical, framework,for, I'll, say, in, the, future, is, physics.
I'd, recommend, studying, the, thinking, process,around, physics.
Like, not, just, the, equations, the, equations,are, certainly, very, helpful, but, the, way, of, thinking, in, physics, it's, the,best, framework, for, understanding, things, that, are, counter–intuitive.
And, you, know, always, take, the, position, that,you, are, to, some, degree, wrong, and, your, goal, is, to, be, less, wrong, over, time.
One, of, the, biggest, mistakes, people, generally,make, and, I'm, guilty, of, it, too, is, wishful, thinking.
You, know, like, you, want, something, to, be, true,even, if, it, isn't, true.
And, so, you, ignore, the, things, that.
You, ignore, the, real, truth, because, of, what,you, want, to, be, true.
This, is, a, very, difficult, trap, to, avoid.
And, like, I, said, it's, certainly, one, that, I,find, myself, in, having, problems, with.
But, if, you, just, take, that, approach, of, that,you're, always, to, some, degree, wrong, and, your, goal, is, to, be, less, wrong.
And, solicit, critical, feedback, particularly,from, friends.
Like, friends, if, somebody, loves, you, they,want, the, best, for, you.
They, don't, want, to, tell, you, the, bad, things.
So, you, have, to, ask, them, and, say:, I, do, really,want, to, know.
And, then, they, will, tell, you.
Thank, you, very, much.
It's, been.
It's, great, for, the, World, Government, Summit,to, have, a, legend, who's, creating, the, future, for, humanity,to, share, his, thoughts, his, ideas, his, visions, challenges,and, his, hope, for, life.
Thank, you, very, much.
Thanks, for, having, me
