In, life, we've, seen, within, this, part, of, the,world, great, people, like, Al-Khawarizmi, who, invented,algorithm.
Globally, Newton, Henry, Ford, the, Wright, Brothers,Albert, Einstein, and, Elon, Musk.,,,,,
See, you, are, in, rush,You, want, to, go, to, places, that, nobody, has, been.,,
It's, an, honor, to, be, here.,,,,,,,,,,,
And, I'm, having, a, really, great, time, with, my,kids, in, Dubai.,,,,,
It's, really, been, fantastic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I, really, encourage,anyone, who, hasn't, been, to, visit, what, a, great, city!, Thank, you.,,
And, in, terms, of, the, motivations,I, used, to, like, this, sort, of.,,,,
kind, of, a, long, version, of, the, explanation,but.,,,,,,,,
And.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So, I, think, there, are, certain, things, that,are, necessary, to, ensure, that, the, future, is, good.
And, to, be, a, space, exploring, civilization.,,,,,,,,,,
And, for, humanity, to, be, out, there, among, the,stars.,,,,,,,
And, be, a, multi-planetary, species.,,,,,,,,,,,,
And, that's, one, reason, kind, of, like, life,insurance, for, life, collectively.,,,,,
Life, as, we, know, it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
I, think, that, space, invasion, is, incredibly,exciting, and, inspiring.,,,,,,,
And, there, need, to, be, reasons, to, get, up, in,the, morning.,,,,,
You, know, life, can't, just, be, about, solving,problems.,,,,,,,,
Particularly, when, you, see, the, advancement,of, something, like, video, games.,,,,,,
And, you're, like, batting, it, back, and, forth.,,,,,,,,,
-, I, played, it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-, Yeah, me, too, exactly.,,,,,,,,,,,,
-, Us, all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-, It, sort, of, dates, you, a, little, bit.,,,,,,,,
Yeah, we, both, played, the, same, game.,,,,,,,,,,
And, that, was, like, a, pretty, fun, game, at, the,time.,,,,,,
And, and, you, see, where, things, are, going, with,virtual, reality.,,,,,,
Interesting.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I, mean, it, could, be.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Everything, is, possible, in, life.,,,,,,,,,,,,
I, mean, there's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah, particularly, like, things, tend, to, be,accelerating, to, something.,,,,,,,
-, Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-, In, the, past, 20, years.,,,,,,,,,,,
-, It's, getting, faster, and, faster.,,,,,,,,,,,
When, you, think, of, say, the, first, controlled,power, flight, was, in, 1903, with, the, Wright, Brothers.
And, then, 66, years, later, we, put, the, first,people, on, the, moon.,,,,
What, are, you, talking, about, Like, this, sounds, so, crazy.,,,,,,,
But, today, with, a, hundred-dollar, device, you,can, video-conference, with, anyone, in, the, world.,,,
On, the, other, side, of, the, world, and, if, you,have, a, Wi-Fi, connection, it's, basically, free.
You're, free, to, have, an, instant, visual, communication,with, anyone, or, even, with, millions, of, people.,
You, know, with, social, media, you, can, communicate,to, millions, of, people, simultaneously.,,,,
So, and, you, can, google, something, and, ask, any,question.,,,,,,,
It, would, be, incredibly, difficult, to, predict,these, things, in, the, past.,,,,,
Even, the, relatively, recent, past.,,,,,,,,,,,,
This, may, just, be, wishful, thinking.,,,,,,,,,,,
I, mean, I, hope, we, are, out, there, on, Mars, and,maybe, beyond, Mars, Jupiter.,,
I, hope, we're, traveling, frequently, throughout,the, solar, system, perhaps, preparing, for, missions, to, nearby, star,systems.
I, think, all, of, that, is, possible, in, 50, years.,,,,,,,
And, I, think, it's, going, to, be, very, exciting,to, do, that.,,,,,
And, I, think, we'll, see, autonomy, and, artificial,intelligence, advance, tremendously.,,,,,,
Like, that's, actually, quite, near, term.,,,,,,,,,,,
-, 10, years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-, 10, years, from, now, Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,
I, think, almost, all, cars, built, will, be, able,of, full, autonomy, in, about, 10, years.,
And, we, think, probably, enough, compute, power,to, be, safer, than, a, person.,,,,
So, it's, mostly, just, the, question, of, developing,the, software, and, uploading, the, software.,,,
And, if, it, turns, out, that, more, compute, power,is, needed, we, can, easily, upgrade, the, computer.
And, so, that's, all, Teslas, built, since, October,last, year.,,,,,,,
And, other, manufacturers, will, follow, and, do,the, same, thing.,,,,,,,
So, getting, in, a, car, will, be, like, getting,in, an, elevator.,,,,,
And, that, will, be, normal, that, will, just, be,normal.,,,,,,,
Like, for, elevators, they, used, to, be, elevator,operators.,,,,,,,,
You, get, in, there, will, be, a, guy, moving, a, lever.,,,,,,
Now, you, just, get, in, you, press, the, button,and, that's, taken, for, granted.,,,
So, autonomy, will, be, wide-spread.,,,,,,,,,,,,
I, think, one, of, the, most, troubling, questions,is, artificial, intelligence.,,,,,,
And, I, don't, mean, narrow, AI, like,vehicle, autonomy, I, would, put, in, the, narrow, AI, class.
It's, narrowly, trying, to, achieve, a, certain,function.,,,,,,,,,
This, I, think, is, a, dangerous, situation.,,,,,,,,,,
-, Why, is, that, -, I, think, it's, both.,,,,,,,,
-, Super, intelligent.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-, So, you, think, within, 20, years.,,,,,,,,,,
-, Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-, we'll, have, aliens, on, Earth, Well, digital, super, intelligence, will, be, like,an, alien.,,
-, It, will, be, like, an, alien.,,,,,,,,,,
-, Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some, people, think, I'm, an, alien.,,,,,,,,,,,
Not, true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-, Not, true.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-, But, maybe, we, are, aliens.,,,,,,,,,,,
Maybe, we, aliens.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I, mean, if, you, look, at, this, part, of, the, world.,,,,,,
Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
They, believe, that, human, beings, are, not, from,Earth, they, came, from, somewhere, else.,,,
Eve, and, Adam, came, from, somewhere, else, to, Earth.,,,,,,,,
So, in, a, way, human, beings, are, aliens, to, this,land.,,,,,,
If, there, are, super, intelligent, aliens, out,there, they're, probably, already, observing, us.,,,,
That, would, seem, quite, likely, and, we're, not,smart, enough, to, realize, it.,,,,
But, I, can, do, some, back, of, the, envelope, calculations,and.,,,,,,
Maybe, 20, million, years, max.,,,,,,,,,,,,
This, is, nothing, in, the, grand, scheme, of, things.,,,,,,,,
Once, you, said, you, wanted, to, die, on, Mars.,,,,,,,,
Why, To, be, clear, I, don't, want, to, die, on, Mars.,,,,,,
It's, like, if.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But, it's, not, some, kind, of, Mars, death, wish.,,,,,,,,
And, if, I, do, die, on, Mars, I, just, don't, want,to, go, on, impact.,,
Let's, come, back, to, Earth, actually.,,,,,,,,,,,
You, tweeted, that, you, are, building, a, tunnel,under, Washington, D,C.,,,,,
Why, What, is, it, -, It's, a, secret, plot.,,,,,,,,
-, Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-, Just, between, us.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-, Nobody, helps, you, Yeah, exactly, let's, keep, that, a, secret.,,,,,,
I, think, this, is, going, to, sound, a, little.,,,,,,,,
I, mean, it, seems, like, so, much, trivial, or, silly,but.,,,,,,
So, you, can, always, go, deeper, than, you, can,go, up.,,,,,,
Like, the, deepest, mines, are, deeper, than, the,tallest, buildings.,,,,,,,
And, so, given, that, you, can, overcome, the, congestion,situation, in, any, city, in, the, world.,
And, so, that's, why, I, think, it's, an, important,technology.,,,,,,,
So, then, you, get, the, traffic, jam.,,,,,,,,,,
Let's, come, back, to,,your, year, in, Dubai.,,,,,,,,
Why, now, I, think, actually, things, are, going, really, well,in, China.,,,,,
Well, the, most, near, to, impact, from, a, technological,standpoint, is, autonomous, cars, like, fully, self-driving,cars.
I'd, say, that's, going, to, happen, much, faster,than, people, realize.,,,,,,
So, if.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And, so, then, we, need, to, figure, out, new, rules,for, what, do, these, people, do.,
But, it, will, all, be, very, disruptive, and, very,quick.,,,,,,,
I, should, characterize, what, I, mean, by, quick.,,,,,,,,,
Because, there, are.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Quick, means, different, things, to, different,people.,,,,,,,,,,
There, are, about, two, billion, vehicles, in, the,world.,,,,,,,,
Approaching, in, fact, 2,5, billion, cars, and, trucks,in, the, world.,,,,,
The, total, new, vehicle, production, capacity,is, about, a, hundred, million.,,,,,,
So, that, disruption, I'm, talking, about, will,take, place, over, about, 20, years.,,,,
Thank, you.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This, is, the, largest, global, government, summit,we, have, over, 139, governments, here.,,,,
the, development, of, artificial, intelligence.,,,,,,,,,,,,
I, think, this, is, we, need, to, be, just, be, very,careful, in.,,,,
So, I, think, it's, important, for, public, safety,that, we.,,,,,,,
Let's, see, secondly, I, would, say,we, do, need, to, think, about, transport, in, general.,,
Because, that's, probably, something, that, happens,over, 30, or, 40, years.,,,,,,
The, transition, to, electric, vehicles.,,,,,,,,,,,,
So, thinking, about, that, in, context,,the, demand, for, electricity, will, increase, dramatically.,,,
So, over, time, that, will, transition, to, almost,all.,,,,,,,,
not, all, but, predominantly, electricity,which, means, that, the, demand, for, electricity, will, probably, triple.,,
It, seems, they'll, have, an, easy, job, that's,it, there, are, no, more, challenges, for, them.,
-, Universal, basic, income.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-, Universal, basic, income.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I, think, it's, going, to, be, necessary.,,,,,,,,,,
So, it, means, that, unemployed, people, will, be,paid, across, the, globe.,,,,,
-, Yeah.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-, Because, there, are, no, jobs.,,,,,,,,,,,
Machines, robots, are, taking, over.,,,,,,,,,,,,
There, will, be, fewer, and, fewer, jobs, that, a,robot, cannot, do, better.,,,,
That's, simply.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
And, I, want, to, be, clear, these, are, not, things,that, I, wish, would, happen.,,
These, are, simply, things, that, I, think, probably,will, happen.,,,,,,,
And, I, think, some, kind, of, universal, basic, income,is, going, to, be, necessary.,,,
Now, the, output, of, goods, and, services, will,be, extremely, high.,,,,,,
So, with, automation,there, will, come, abundance.,,,,,,,,,,
There, will, be.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
almost, everything, will, get,very, cheap.,,,,,,,,,,,
The.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I, think, the, biggest.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I, think, we'll, just, end, up, doing,a, universal, basic, income.,,,,,,
It's, going, to, be, necessary.,,,,,,,,,,,,
if, you're, not, needed,if, there's, not, a, need, for, your, labor, how, do, you.,,
But, having, some, sort, of, merger, with, biological,intelligence, and, machine, intelligence.,,,,,
To, some, degree, we, are, already, a, cyborg.,,,,,,,,,
And, and, so, you, already, have, a, digital, touchery,layer.,,,,,,,
So, you, already, have, that, and, I, think, if,somebody, dies, their, digital, ghost, is, still, around.
All, of, their, e-mails, and, the, pictures, that,they, posted, and, their, social, media.,,,
That, still, lives, even, if, they, died.,,,,,,,,,,
So, over, time, I, think, we'll, probably, see,a, closer, merger, of, biological, intelligence, and, digital, intelligence.
And, that's, just, very, slow.,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm, getting, pretty, esoteric, here, I, don't,know, is, this, is.,,,,,,
It's, close, we, got, it.,,,,,,,,,,,,
Always, you, think, out, of, the, box.,,,,,,,,,,
Your, ideas, are, so, huge.,,,,,,,,,,,,
You, want, to, go, to, space, you, decided, to, go,to, space, you, did, it.,,
-, Then, it, landed.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-, 4, times, that, I, care, to, count.,,,,,,,,,
How, do, you, come, with, these, ideas, Sometimes, they, are, pushing, the, human, limit.,,,
You, are, always, pushing, the, human, limit, why, Well, I.,,,,,,,
Just, as, we, have, for, air, crafts.,,,,,,,,,,
You, can, imagine, that, if, an, air, craft, was, a,single, use, almost, no, one, would, fly.
Because, you, can, buy, like, say, 747, might, be.,,,,,,,,
250, million, Dollars, 300, million, Dollars,something, like, that.,,,,,,,,
You, need, two, of, them, for, a, round, trip.,,,,,,,,
But, nobody, is, going, to, pay, millions, of, Dollars,for, a, ticket, to, fly.,,,
To, do, air, travel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So, but, because, you, can, re-use, the, air, craft,tens, of, thousands, of, times, the.,,
Air, travel, becomes, much, more, affordable.,,,,,,,,,,,
And, the, same, is, true, of, rockets.,,,,,,,,,,
Our, rocket, costs.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60, million, Dollars, roughly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So, a, capital, cost, if, it, can, be, used, once,in, 60, million, Dollars.,,,
But, if, the, capital, cost, if, it, can, be, used,a, thousand, times, is, 60, thousand, Dollars.
So, it's, truly, fundamental,because, earth, gravity, is, quite, deep.,,,,,,,
Earth, has, a, fairly, high, gravity.,,,,,,,,,,,
That's, why, a, fully, reusable, rocket, hasn't,been, developed, that, far.,,,,,,
Fortunately, if, Earth, gravity, was, even, 10,per, cent, stronger, I, would, say, it, wouldn't, be, impossible.
You, need, a, team, around, you, to, deliver, a, lot,of, ideas.,,,,,
So, when, I, interview, somebody,the, main, questions, are, always, the, same.,,,,,
What, do, you, ask, I, say:, Tell, me, the, story, of, your, life.,,,,
And, the, decisions, that, you, made, along, the,way, and, why, you, made, them.,,,
And,that, question, I, think, is, very, important, because.,,,,,,,,
the, people, that, really, solved, the, problem,they, know, exactly, how, they, solved, it.,,,
They, know, the, little, details.,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm, trying, to, sort, which, is, the, worst.,,,,,,,,,
I, think, just, thinking, about, how, to, spend, time.,,,,,,,,
-, That's, very, difficult.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-, Yes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Time, is, over.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'll, ask, you, just, one, last, question.,,,,,,,,,,
If, you, allow, me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In, the, World, Government, Summit, we, have,so, many, people, from.,,,,,,
so, many, young, people, actually,from, across, the, Globe.,,,,,,,,
If, you, have, an, advice, to, them,young, people, globally, who, want, to, be, like, Elon, Musk.
What's, your, advice, to, them, I, think, that, probably, they, shouldn't, want,to, be.,,,
-, You, -, I, think, it, sounds, better, than, it, is.,,,,,,
Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yeah, it's, not, as, much, fun, being, me, as, you'd,think.,,,,,,
-, I, don't, know.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
-, You, don't, think, so, It, could, be, worse, for, sure.,,,,,,
But, it's.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'm, not, sure, I, want, to, be, me.,,,,,,,,,
Okay.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
But.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I'd, recommend, studying, the, thinking, process,around, physics.,,,,,,,,,
One, of, the, biggest, mistakes, people, generally,make, and, I'm, guilty, of, it, too, is, wishful, thinking.
You, know, like, you, want, something, to, be, true,even, if, it, isn't, true.,,,
And, so, you, ignore, the, things, that.,,,,,,,,,,
You, ignore, the, real, truth, because, of, what,you, want, to, be, true.,,,,
This, is, a, very, difficult, trap, to, avoid.,,,,,,,,,
And, like, I, said, it's, certainly, one, that, I,find, myself, in, having, problems, with.,,
And, solicit, critical, feedback, particularly,from, friends.,,,,,,,,,,
Like, friends, if, somebody, loves, you, they,want, the, best, for, you.,,,,,
They, don't, want, to, tell, you, the, bad, things.,,,,,,,,
So, you, have, to, ask, them, and, say:, I, do, really,want, to, know.,,,
And, then, they, will, tell, you.,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank, you, very, much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It's, been.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thank, you, very, much.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thanks, for, having, me,,,,,,,,,,,,,
